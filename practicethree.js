// Q3. What are the data types supported by JavaScript?
// The data types supported by JavaScript are:

// Undefined
// Null
// Boolean
// String
// Symbol
// Number
// Object

// Q7. How can you create an object in JavaScript?
// JavaScript supports Object concept very well. You can create an object using the object literal as follows −

// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4
// var emp = {
// name: "Daniel",
// age: 23
// };

// Q8. How can you create an Array in JavaScript?
// You can define arrays using the array literal as follows-


// 1
// 2
// var x = [];
// var y = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Q9. What is a name function in JavaScript & how to define it?
// A named function declares a name as soon as it is defined. It can be defined using function keyword as :

// 1
// 2
// 3
// function named(){
// // write code here
// }

// Q12. What are the scopes of a variable in JavaScript?
// The scope of a variable is the region of your program in which it is defined. JavaScript variable will have only two scopes.
// • Global Variables − A global variable has global scope which means it is visible everywhere in your JavaScript code.
// • Local Variables − A local variable will be visible only within a function where it is defined. Function parameters are always local to that function.

// Q13. What is the purpose of ‘This’ operator in JavaScript?
// The JavaScript this keyword refers to the object it belongs to. This has different values depending on where it is used. In a method, this refers to the owner object and in a function, this refers to the global object.

// Q15. What is Closure? Give an example.
// Closures are created whenever a variable that is defined outside the current scope is accessed from within some inner scope. It gives you access to an outer function’s scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created. To use a closure, simply define a function inside another function and expose it.

// Q17. What are the variable naming conventions in JavaScript?
// The following rules are to be followed while naming variables in JavaScript:

// You should not use any of the JavaScript reserved keyword as variable name. For example, break or boolean variable names are not valid.
// JavaScript variable names should not start with a numeral (0-9). They must begin with a letter or the underscore character. For example, 123name is an invalid variable name but _123name or name123 is a valid one.
// JavaScript variable names are case sensitive. For example, Test and test are two different variables.

// Q18. How does TypeOf Operator work?
// The typeof operator is used to get the data type of its operand. The operand can be either a literal or a data structure such as a variable, a function, or an object. It is a unary operator that is placed before its single operand, which can be of any type. Its value is a string indicating the data type of the operand.
